# Senior-Project
# This code was created for my undergraduate senior project
# Python3 was used for this program, and is required to run it.
# findGene.py is a python file used to find genes when a given FASTA-formatted file is used as input that contains the coding regions of a given genome.
# The given output will be every gene that is mentioned in the file.
# To run the file on the command line, type python findGene.py
# Options:
# -i [input file]
# This is the FASTA-formatted file used as input that contains the coding regions of a given genome
# -o [output file]
# This is the file to specify that will contain every gene from the input file.
# If no options are selected, the program will first ask you for the input file. Then, it will print the genes to the screen instead of creating an output file.
# An example of running this is seen below:
# python findGene.py -i lactobacillus-acidophilus-coding-regions.txt -o out.txt
